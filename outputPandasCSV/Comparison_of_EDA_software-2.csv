0,Electric,"*BSD, Java",GPL,Yes,VLSI circuit design tool with connectivity at all levels. Can also be used for schematic entry and PCB design.
1,FreePCB,w32,GPL,Yes,"A printed circuit board design program for Microsoft Windows. FreePCB allows for up to 16 copper layers, both metric and US customary units, and export of designs in Gerber format. Boards can be partially or fully autorouted with the FreeRouting[11] autorouter by using the FpcROUTE Specctra DSN design file translator."
2,Fritzing,"Windows, Mac, Linux",GPL,Yes,"Protoboard view, schematic view, PCB view, Code (firmware) view. Includes customizable design rule checker. Includes common shaped boards like Arduino and Raspberry Pi shields. Allows spline curve traces. Only two layers (top and bottom). Outputs gerbers."
3,gEDA,"*BSD, Linux, Mac",GPL,Yes,"schematic, simulation, PCB editor, gerber view"
4,Gnucap,any (C++98),GPL3,,Mixed-signal circuit simulator
5,Icarus Verilog,"*BSD, Linux, Mac",GPL,,Verilog simulator
6,KiCad,"Linux, Mac, Windows",GNU GPL,"Built-in, or FreeRouting","Full package for schematic and board design, etc. Design rule checking. User-defined symbols and footprints. Gerber/ drill file creation. Graphic interface. Active user community."
7,KTechLab,Linux,GPL,,KTechLab is a schematic capture and simulator. It is specifically geared toward mixed signal simulation of analog components and small digital processors.
8,Magic,Linux,BSD license,no,A very-large-scale integration layout tool
9,Ngspice,"Linux, Solaris, Mac, NetBSD, FreeBSD, w32",BSD,,SPICE + XSPICE + Cider
10,Oregano,,GPL,no,Schematic capture + spice simulation
11,Quite Universal Circuit Simulator (QUCS),"Linux, Solaris, Mac, NetBSD, FreeBSD, w32",GPL,,Schematic capture + Verilog + VHDL + simulation
12,pcb-rnd,"*BSD, Linux, Mac, w32",GPL,yes,"Circuit layout program with extended file format support, DRC, parametric footprints, query language, and GUI and command line operation for batch processing and automation"
13,Verilator,Posix,GPL,,"Verilator is the fastest free Verilog HDL simulator. It compiles synthesizable Verilog into cycle accurate C++ or SystemC code following 2-state synthesis (zero delay) semantics. Benchmarks reported on its website suggest it is several times faster than commercial event driven simulators such as ModelSim, NC-Verilog and VCS, while not quite as fast as commercial cycle accurate modeling tools such as Carbon ModelStudio and ARC VTOC."
14,XCircuit,Unix,GPL,,Used to produce netlists and publish high-quality drawings.
